# Operating-Platforms_COURSE

The gaming room is a client that has a game application, Draw it or Lose it that was created for Android Systems. They would like to expand it in order to reach more users. So they thought of supporting other platforms. We have been asked to simulate the environment that demonstrates prototypes to present multiple platform options to our client.

Since this application is going to be serving many users, we have decided to adopt the cloud specifically AWS Services as our main hosting and virtual private cloud provider. Since users arround the world will be joining and connecting to our services, we will need some type of high availability in multiple AZs. We also decided to apply the client-server architecture since everyone using the application will be listening and requesting data from our server.

I learned that designing a software document is so important, it put me on a track that is defined where it starts and where it ends, and it gave me expectation of what I will be facing next so I can think the right way when fixing what I am working on now.

The recommendations part can be more informative and based on more research, throughout the years I have developed application and adopted the things I recommended.

If we don't comply to what the user needs we will be losing customers, our users are the main goal and what they need can be translated in a good UX experience. 

Designing a software is pretty fun and productive. It requires a lot of research to translate what the client needs in services. It all depends on what the requirements are and what is available and what the team is capable to do.
